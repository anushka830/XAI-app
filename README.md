# 🧠 Explainable AI Dashboard - Diabetes Prediction

This project demonstrates the use of Explainable AI (XAI) techniques to understand and interpret machine learning model predictions. The app predicts whether a person is diabetic based on medical inputs and explains the decision using SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) plots.
